# Computer_Network
Course objectives: This course will enable students to:
1. Choose suitable tools to model a network and understand the protocols at various OSI reference 
levels.
2. Design a suitable network and simulate using a Network simulator tool.
3. Simulate the networking concepts and protocols using C/C++ programming.
4. Model the networks for different configurations and analyze the results.
Laboratory Experiments
PART-A: Simulation experiments using NS2/ NS3/ OPNET/ NCTUNS/ NetSim/QualNet or any other 
equivalent tool
1. Implement a point to point network with four nodes and duplex links between them. Analyze the network 
performance by setting the queue size and varying the bandwidth.
2. Implement a four node point to point network with links n0-n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent 
between n0-n3 and UDP between n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing 
the parameter and determine the number of packets sent by TCP/UDP.
3. Implement Ethernet LAN using n (6-10) nodes. Compare the throughput by changing the error rate and 
data rate.
4. Implement Ethernet LAN using n nodes and assign multiple traffic to the nodes and obtain congestion 
window for different sources/ destinations.
5. Implement ESS with transmission nodes in Wireless LAN and obtain the performance parameters.
6. Implementation of Link state routing algorithm.
PART-B: Implement the following in C/C++
1. Write a program for a HLDC frame to perform the following i) Bit Stuffing ii) Character Stuffing.
2. Write a program for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path for transmission.
3. Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to compute the shortest routing path.
4. For the given data, use CRC-CCITT polynomial to obtain CRC code. Verify the program for the cases(a) 
Without error (b) With error
5. Implementation of Stop and Wait Protocol and Sliding Window Protocol
6. Write a program for congestion control using Leaky Bucket Algorithm# Computer_Network
